`Xlearn <https://github.com/tomography/xlearn>`_ implements Deep Neural Network to
X-ray science imaging problems including:

* Tomography rotation axis calibration :cite:`RN93`.
  
* Low-dose image enhancement :cite:`RN140`.

* Feature extraction, segmentation :cite:`RN155`.

* Super-resolution X-ray microscopy (will update later).

* Solving inverse problems with deep learning, such as tomography reconstruction :cite:`RN85` and phase retrieval.
