In parallel-beam microtomography, where resolution in the 1 $\mu$m range is reached, the center of rotation is often only known with insufficient accuracy. We present three image metrics for the scoring of tomographic reconstructions and an iterative procedure for the determination of the position of the optimum center of rotation. The metrics are applied to model systems as well as to microtomography data from a synchrotron radiation source. The center of rotation is determined using the image metrics and compared with the results obtained by the center-of-mass method and by image registration. It is found that the image metrics make it possible to determine the axis position reliably at well below the resolution of one detector bin in an automated procedure.},  Bdsk-url-1               = {http://josaa.osa.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josaa-23-5-1048},  Bdsk-url-2               = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.23.001048},  Date-added               = {2015-09-09 03:30:05 +0000},  Date-modified            = {2015-09-09 03:30:27 +0000},  Doi                      = {10.1364/JOSAA.23.001048},  Opturl                   = {http://josaa.osa.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josaa-23-5-1048},  Publisher                = {OSA}}@article{Guizar:08,author = {GS Manuel and ST Thurman and JR Fienup},title = {Efficient subpixel image registration algorithms},journal = {Optics Letters},year = {2008},volume = {33},number = {2},pages = {156--158}}@InProceedings{dowd:99,  Title                    = {Developments in synchrotron x-ray computed microtomography at the National Synchrotron Light Source},  Author                   = {Dowd, Betsy A. and Campbell, Graham H. and Marr, Robert B. and Nagarkar, Vivek V. and Tipnis, Sameer V. and Axe, Lisa and Siddons, D.

This is a third-generation instrument capable of producing tomographic volumes of 1 - 2 micron resolution over a 2 - 3 mm field of view. Recent enhancements will be discussed. These have focused on two issues: the desire for real-time data acquisition and processing and the need for highly monochromatic beam (.1/100 energy bandpass). The latter will permit k-edge subtraction studies and will provide improved image contrast from below the Cr (6 keV) up to the Cs (36 keV) k-edge. A range of applications that benefit from these improvements will be discussed as well. These two goals are somewhat counterproductive, however; higher monochromaticity yields a lower flux forcing longer data acquisition times. To balance the two, a more efficient scintillator for X-ray conversion is being developed. Some testing of a prototype scintillator has been performed; preliminary results will be presented here. In the meantime, data reconstruction times have been reduced, and the entire tomographic acquisition, reconstruction and volume rendering process streamlined to make efficient use of synchrotron beam time. A Fast Filtered Back Transform (FFBT) reconstruction program recently developed helped to reduce the time to reconstruct a volume of 150 X 150 X 250 pixels3 (over 5 million voxels) from the raw camera data to 1.5 minutes on a dual R10,000 CPU. With these improvements, one can now obtain a 'quick look' of a small tomographic volume (approximately 106 voxels) in just over 15 minutes from the start of data acquisition.},  Bdsk-url-1               = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.363725},  Date-added               = {2015-09-09 03:28:30 +0000},  Date-modified            = {2015-09-09 03:28:43 +0000},  Doi                      = {10.1117/12.363725},  Journal                  = {Proc.

The new method is a generalization of the one proposed by Titarenko and collaborators, with a complete sinogram restoration prior to reconstruction with classical algorithms. The generalized algorithm can be performed in linear time and is easy to implement. Compared with the original approach, with an explicit solution, this approach is fast through the use of the conjugate gradient method. Also, low/high-resolution sinograms can be restored using higher/lower-order derivatives of the projections. Using different order for the derivative is an advantage over the classical Titarenko's approach.

Well-known techniques based on center of mass calculation, image registration, or reconstruction evaluation work well under favourable conditions but they fail in cases where samples are larger than field of view, when the projections show low signal-to-noise, or when optical defects dominate the contrast. Here we propose an alternative technique which is based on the Fourier analysis of the sinogram. Our technique shows excellent performance particularly on challenging data.},  Bdsk-url-1               = {http://www.opticsexpress.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-22-16-19078},  Bdsk-url-2               = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.22.019078},  Date-added               = {2015-09-09 03:36:38 +0000},  Date-modified            = {2015-09-09 03:36:46 +0000},  Doi                      = {10.1364/OE.22.019078},  Opturl                   = {http://www.opticsexpress.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-22-16-19078},  Publisher                = {OSA}}@InProceedings{Xu:06,  Title                    = {A comparative study of popular interpolation and integration methods for use in computed tomography},  Author                   = {Xu, Fang and Mueller, Klaus},  Booktitle                = {Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro, 2006. 3rd IEEE International Symposium on},  Year                     = {2006},  Organization             = {IEEE},  Pages                    = {1252--1255},  Owner                    = {pelt},  Timestamp                = {2015.10.15}}@article{LeCun:2015,	author = {LeCun, Yann and Bengio, Yoshua and Hinton, Geoffrey},	title = {Deep learning},	journal = {Nature},	volume = {521},	number = {7553},	pages = {436-444},	ISSN = {0028-0836},	DOI = {10.1038/nature14539},	year = {2015},	type = {Journal Article}}@inproceedings{RN65,	author = {LeCun, Y. and Kavukcuoglu, K. and Farabet, C.},	title = {Convolutional networks and applications in vision},	booktitle = {Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems},	pages = {253-256},	ISBN = {0271-4302},	DOI = {10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537907},	year = {2010},	type = {Conference Proceedings}}@article{RN66,	author = {Pereira, F. and Mitchell, T. and Botvinick, M.},	title = {Machine learning classifiers and fMRI: A tutorial overview},	journal = {Neuroimage},	volume = {45},	number = {1},	pages = {S199-S209},	ISSN = {1053-8119},	DOI = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.11.007},	year = {2009},	type = {Journal Article}}@article{RN54,	author = {Lecun, Y. and Bottou, L. and Bengio, Y. and Haffner, P.},	title = {Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition},	journal = {Proceedings of the Ieee},	volume = {86},	number = {11},	pages = {2278-2324},	ISSN = {0018-9219},	DOI = {10.1109/5.726791},	year = {1998},	type = {Journal Article}}@article{RN62,	author = {Mirowski, Piotr and Madhavan, Deepak and LeCun, Yann and Kuzniecky, Ruben},	title = {Classification of patterns of EEG synchronization for seizure prediction},	journal = {Clinical Neurophysiology},	volume = {120},	number = {11},	pages = {1927-1940},	ISSN = {1388-2457},	DOI = {10.1016/j.clinph.2009.09.002},	year = {2009},	type = {Journal Article}}@article{RN49,	author = {Lawrence, S. and Giles, C.
